Configuration for BootForums
Very simple, read comment, make changes where it's needed. I would recommend not changing captchaLogin as it helps prvent bruteforce attacks, and is simple to type an extra 4-6 chars.
Full branding is supported, and ENCOURAGED, so please find the title, desc, copyright, and footer options and change them =)
Script Created by Mitchell Urgero
Date: Sometime in 2016 ;)
Website: https://urgero.org
E-Mail: info@urgero.org
Script is distributed with Open Source Licenses, do what you want with it. ;)
"I wrote this because I saw that there are not that many databaseless Forums for PHP. It needed to be done. I think it works great, looks good, and is VERY mobile friendly. I just hope at least one other person
finds this PHP script as useful as I do."
